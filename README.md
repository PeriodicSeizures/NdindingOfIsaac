# NdindingOfIsaac

Ndless implementation of the dungeon exploration game Binding of Isaac

This project is currently halted as I don't have the time to dev, also due to too much c++/c to learn.

Features Isaac, a room, animated movement, room collision, collision with a rock in the upper-left corner.

Run with Ndless 4.5, on CX, (classic will crash). 

- Will open splash screen, then must press enter until room reached.
- Move with WASD. Exit to menu with 'esc'.
