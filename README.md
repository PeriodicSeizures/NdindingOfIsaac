# NdindingOfIsaac

Ndless implementation of the dungeon exploration game Binding of Isaac

Is currently not in progress, too much c++/c to learn (might redo in c-lang due to behavior I'm not used to experiencing with c++).

Features Isaac, a room, animated movement, room collision, collision with a rock in the upper-left corner.
